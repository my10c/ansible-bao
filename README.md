The ansible setup use by our devops/sre team

### Background

### Notes
- the directory .ssh and .vault should be set to mode 0700
- the files .ssh/id* and .vault/passwd.vault should be set to mode 0400
- suggestions are *very* welcome! always love to improve our code
- we are looking to us IPv6 once the cloud providers supports [RFC 4193](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4193)
- the script `create_random_password` (under bin) can be use to generate random string to be use fro password
